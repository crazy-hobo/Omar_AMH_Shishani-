<h1>Welcome, my name is Omar Shishani</h1>
<h2>This is my page, where you can learn a little about my story.</h2>
<p>During my early schooling as a civil engineer, I began to hear about coding, and wanted to pursue a stimulating, lucrative career that wasn't going to take me another seven years to complete.</p>
<p>Today I am learning to be a web developer. I am teaching myself currently using freeCodeCamp, and Colt Steele's "Web Developer Bootcamp" on UDemy.</p>
